I decided as an experiment to vibe code a research paper, in particular an old minor result I never had written up showing that the S<sup>2</sup><sub>P<\sub>\-search problem is equivalent to TFNPNP. 

I used Google Antigravity with Gemini 3 as the base model. I used the term “vibe code” because Gemini created the LaTeX code that compiles into the paper.

It went better than expected, taking only eight prompts and some light editing of the final paper. It felt like working with a graduate student. The paper appears on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02808). .
